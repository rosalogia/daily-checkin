* Overview

This guide covers everything you need to know to set up and use the Daily Check-in Bot in your Discord server. The bot helps create accountability and track progress toward personal goals through daily check-ins with streak tracking.

* Bot Setup & Installation

** Prerequisites
- A Discord server where you have administrative permissions
- The Daily Check-in Bot invited to your server with proper permissions

** Required Bot Permissions
The bot needs these permissions to function properly:
- Send Messages
- Create Public Threads  
- Mention Everyone (for daily pings)
- Use Slash Commands
- Read Message History

** Initial Server Configuration

*** 1. Set Check-in Channel
First, configure where daily messages will be posted:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/set-checkin-channel channel:#your-channel
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Example:*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/set-checkin-channel channel:#daily-checkins
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** 2. Set Daily Posting Time & Timezone
Configure when daily messages are posted:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/set-checkin-time time:HH:MM timezone:Your/Timezone
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Examples:*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/set-checkin-time time:09:00 timezone:America/New_York
/set-checkin-time time:18:00 timezone:Europe/London
/set-checkin-time time:06:30 timezone:Asia/Tokyo
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Common Timezones:*
- =America/New_York= (Eastern Time)
- =America/Chicago= (Central Time) 
- =America/Denver= (Mountain Time)
- =America/Los_Angeles= (Pacific Time)
- =Europe/London= (GMT/BST)
- =Europe/Berlin= (CET/CEST)
- =Asia/Tokyo= (JST)
- =Australia/Sydney= (AEST/AEDT)

* User Commands

** Registration & Goal Management

*** Register for Daily Check-ins
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/register-goal goal:"Your personal goal or objective"
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Examples:*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/register-goal goal:"Exercise for 30 minutes daily"
/register-goal goal:"Read 10 pages of a book each day"
/register-goal goal:"Practice guitar for 20 minutes"
/register-goal goal:"Write 500 words for my novel"
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Edit Your Goal
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/edit-goal goal:"Your updated goal"
#+END_EXAMPLE

*Example:*
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/edit-goal goal:"Exercise for 45 minutes daily and track calories"
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Leave Daily Check-ins
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/deregister
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Re-registration
If you use =/register-goal= again after being registered:
- Your goal will be updated
- Your streak will be reset to 0
- All other data (longest streak, etc.) is preserved

* Daily Check-in Process

** How Daily Check-ins Work

1. **Daily Post**: The bot automatically posts a daily message at your configured time
2. **Thread Creation**: A thread is created under each daily post with the date (e.g., "Daily Check-in Responses 11/17/25")
3. **User Pings**: All registered users are pinged with their current goals and streak counts
4. **Response Window**: Users have 24 hours from the daily post creation to respond
5. **Streak Tracking**: Responding in the thread counts toward your daily streak

** Sample Daily Message
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
🌅 **Daily Check-in Time!**

Time to share your progress! Reply in this thread with your update.

* @John - Exercise for 30 minutes daily 🔥12
* @Sarah - Read 10 pages daily 🔥5  
* @Mike - Practice guitar for 20 minutes 🔥0
* @Lisa - Write 500 words for my novel 🔥23

💪 Keep up the momentum!
#+END_EXAMPLE

** How to Check In
Simply reply to the daily thread with any message about your progress:

*Good Examples:*
- "Completed my 30-minute run this morning!"
- "Read 15 pages of my book during lunch"
- "Practiced guitar scales for 25 minutes"
- "Wrote 600 words today, feeling great!"
- "Struggling today but got 10 minutes in"
- "✅"

*Any response counts* - there's no content validation. The bot just tracks that you participated.

* Streak System

** How Streaks Work
- **New Streak**: Starts at 1 when you first check in
- **Continue Streak**: Check in the next day to increase your streak  
- **Broken Streak**: Miss a day and your streak resets to 0
- **Grace Period**: For streaks ≥30 days, you get a 2-day grace period

** Grace Period Details
For established streaks (30+ days), you can miss up to 2 consecutive days without losing your streak:

- **Days 1-29**: No grace period - miss a day and streak resets
- **Days 30+**: Can miss up to 2 days total during the grace period
- **Grace period resets**: Once you check in again after using grace days

** Response Window
- You have exactly **24 hours** from when the daily post is created to respond
- Late responses don't count toward your streak
- The 24-hour window is based on the daily post time, not midnight

** Streak Display
Streaks are shown in the daily post next to your name:
- =🔥0= - No current streak (starting fresh)
- =🔥5= - 5-day streak
- =🔥42= - 42-day streak

* Administrative Features

** Admin-Only Commands
Only server administrators can use these commands:

*** Channel Configuration
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/set-checkin-channel channel:#new-channel
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Time & Timezone Configuration  
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
/set-checkin-time time:HH:MM timezone:Your/Timezone
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Monitoring Server Activity
Admins can monitor:
- Daily post creation in the configured channel
- User participation in check-in threads
- Streak progress over time

* Troubleshooting

** Common Issues

*** Bot Not Posting Daily Messages
*Check:*
1. Channel is configured with =/set-checkin-channel=
2. Time/timezone is configured with =/set-checkin-time=
3. Bot has permissions in the target channel
4. At least one user is registered

*** My Response Didn't Count  
*Possible reasons:*
1. Responded outside the 24-hour window
2. Responded in the wrong channel (must be in the daily thread)
3. Already responded to this daily post cycle
4. Not registered with =/register-goal=

*** Streak Reset Unexpectedly
*Common causes:*
1. Missed the 24-hour deadline
2. Grace period exceeded (for 30+ day streaks)
3. Re-registered with =/register-goal= (resets streak)

*** Wrong Timezone
Use =/set-checkin-time= with the correct timezone. The bot posts at the configured local time for your server.

** Permission Issues
If commands aren't working, verify the bot has:
- Use Slash Commands
- Send Messages  
- Create Public Threads
- Read Message History

* Best Practices

** For Server Admins
- Choose a consistent daily time that works for most users
- Pick a dedicated channel for daily check-ins
- Consider your server's primary timezone
- Monitor participation and adjust timing if needed

** For Users
- Set realistic, achievable daily goals
- Check in consistently around the same time
- Don't worry about perfect responses - any message counts
- Use the thread to motivate others with your progress
- Update your goal with =/edit-goal= as you evolve

** Building Community
- Celebrate others' streaks and milestones
- Share specific progress details for motivation
- Support users who are struggling or restarting
- Use the daily thread as accountability partnership

* Data & Privacy

** What Data is Stored
- Your Discord user ID
- Your personal goal text
- Check-in dates and streak information
- Server configuration (channel, timezone, posting time)

** What Data is NOT Stored
- The content of your daily responses
- Personal information beyond what you share in goals
- Message history or conversation data

** Data Persistence
- All data is stored locally by the bot operator
- Re-registration preserves historical data but resets current streak
- Deregistration marks you as inactive but preserves data

* Support

If you encounter issues or have questions:
1. Check this usage guide first
2. Verify bot permissions in your server
3. Ensure proper configuration with admin commands
4. Contact your server administrator for configuration issues
